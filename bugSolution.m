To rectify this issue, ensure the delegate object's lifetime is managed appropriately.  Here are a few approaches:

1. **Strong Reference (If Appropriate):** If `MyClass` requires its delegate to persist, change the delegate property to `strong`:

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) id <MyProtocol> delegate;
```

**Caution:** This approach increases the risk of retain cycles.  Use it only when the object's lifetime aligns with that of the delegate and you're certain about the implications.

2. **Delegate Pattern with Retaining:**  Implement a method within the class to set the delegate with retain ownership.

```objectivec
- (void)setMyDelegate:(id<MyProtocol>)newDelegate {
    [_delegate release]; //Release previous delegate object if exist
    _delegate = [newDelegate retain];
}
```

Then make sure you release it as appropriate. 

3. **Using Blocks (For Asynchronous Operations):** For asynchronous tasks, consider using blocks instead of delegates. This approach enhances memory management clarity:

```objectivec
- (void)someMethodWithCompletion:(void (^)(id result))completion {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
        // ... perform asynchronous operations ...
        dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), ^{
            completion(result);
        });
    });
}
```
This method avoids the complexities of delegate management entirely.
