In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves improper handling of object ownership and memory management, particularly when dealing with delegates and blocks.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyDelegate : NSObject <MyProtocol>
@end

@implementation MyDelegate
- (void)myMethod:(id)sender {
    // ...some code...
}
@end

@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, weak) id <MyProtocol> delegate;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    MyDelegate *delegate = [[MyDelegate alloc] init];
    self.delegate = delegate; // weak reference
    [delegate myMethod:self];
    // ...delegate is released here,  it might crash later...
}
@end
```

The `delegate` property is declared as `weak`.  While this prevents retain cycles, it also means that `MyClass` doesn't retain its delegate. Once `someMethod` finishes executing, the `delegate` object might be deallocated, leading to crashes if `MyClass` later attempts to use it.  This is particularly problematic if the delegate object performs asynchronous operations that outlive `someMethod`.
